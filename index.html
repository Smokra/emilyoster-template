            <p>Thank you for your messages after the last post. Both to those of you who appreciated it, and to those
              who
              wrote with thoughts on how could better contribute. I will reflect on all of it; and think more about how
              I
              can amplify the voices of others, and contribute positively here.</p>
            <p>Today we’ll step back into the land of COVID, for an update on pregnancy and kids.</p>
            <p>Next week, I’ll be on vacation and will be taking a break from content production. In lieu of this, I’ll
              post
              a couple of the Explainers from COVID-Explained. Can’t have too much knowledge… and I’ll be back the week
              of
              the 15th.</p>
            <h4>New Data: Pregnancy and Kids</h4>
            <p>Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic it seemed like there was new data coming out every day. Our knowledge
              about
              the consequences of the disease in pregnancy, kids, adults, anyone, was evolving very fast. The pace has
              slowed, however, as things stabilize. It isn’t that there aren’t open questions or more to learn, but
              given
              how much we already know, incremental advances are smaller.</p>
            <p>In the case of pregnancy and kids, we have largely settled around two (reassuring) points:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pregnant women do not seem to be at more risk than non-pregnant women of the same age and with similar
                other risk factors.</li>
              <li>Children — including infant and up through young teens — seem to be at less risk than older people.
                They
                can get very sick, and there is a particular inflammatory syndrome that has been seen in a small number
                of
                cases, but they are overall a less affected group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These basic impressions are increasingly summarized in review articles, like here and here. New data has
              come
              in, but nothing which challenges these basic facts. It seems unlikely, to me, that we will learn more
              either
              of these are very wrong. Which is different from saying there isn’t more to learn — data below — but that
              we
              shouldn’t expect the basic landscape to alter wildly.</p>
            <p>With that background, we can ask what new information we have seen.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 and Pregnancy</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prevalence Some of the new data we’ve gotten in on pregnancy focuses on the prevalence of the virus in
                pregnant women. This is a group that is relatively easy to study, since they are having blood drawn
                frequently. A report from one provider in NY finds that of their 757 patients, 12.2% who had known or
                suspected COVID-19. In contrast, a screening study in Seattle finds only 2.7% of 188 screened patients
                were
                positive. These numbers seem in line with the variation across place in overall prevalence. In the NY
                study,
                nearly all the cases were mild or moderate (one woman was hospitalized).</li>
              <li>Placenta A number of readers sent me this (very dense) article, on placental abnormalities in pregnant
                women with COVID-19. The article reports on a careful study of 16 placentas of women with COVID-19.
                Among
                those women affected in the third trimester (nearly all of them), the authors find a higher rate of
                vascular
                abnormalities than they would expect. If replicated in a larger sample, this would indicate COVID-19
                infection has some impact on the placenta.<br><br>
                There is no direct link made here to issues for either mother or baby. The deliveries in the third
                trimester
                in this study were normal; there was a second-trimester miscarriage included in the data, but it wasn’t
                obviously COVID-19 linked. It’s important, in my mind, to be careful not to over-interpret scary-seeming
                studies like this.</li>
              <li>Mother to Infant Transmission Mother to infant transmission remains relatively rare. A review article
                from
                two weeks ago summarizes 179 cases of women with COVID-19 around delivery. There were 8 infants who
                showed
                evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, largely asymptomatic or mild. In most cases it seems likely infection
                occured during or after birth. The question of whether the virus can be transmitted in utero remains
                somewhat open but it seems at best to be quite rare.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What remains unknown? I think our most significant blind spot is impacts on early trimester pregnancy.
              This
              is due, basically, to the timing: people who had COVID-19 in their first or second trimester largely have
              not
              delivered yet. I will stress: there isn’t anything in the biology of the virus or what we know so far to
              suggest significant concerns.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 and Kids</p>
            <p>One thing that bears saying before we get into new data is that part of why many of us view the data on
              children as reassuring is that in many respiratory or flu-like illnesses, children are among the most
              affected
              groups. If you look, for example, at seasonal flu cases they are highest among children and the elderly —
              the
              age pattern of cases, serious illness and death has a U-shape. Higher for young children and old people,
              lower
              for younger adults.</p>
            <p>We might have expected the same for COVID-19. So the fact that kids seem to be less affected than
              prime-age
              adults is notable. I mention this because I think many people read the idea that the data on kids is
              “reassuring” to say that they cannot get the virus. This isn’t true. They can, and they can get very ill.
              It
              is just that they get it less, and less seriously, than adults. This is surprising because we’d expect the
              opposite.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>MIS-C The most worrisome discussion about COVID-19 and kids, of late, has been about the risk of a
                serious
                inflammatory syndrome. The CDC has labeled this MIS-C; you may also have seen Kawasaki-like syndrome, or
                PMIS. The bottom line is that a small number of children with current or former COVID-19 infection have
                been
                presenting with serious (although largely treatable) illness.<br>The NYC Department of Health has a good
                summary here.<br><br>The exact sense in which this is linked to COVID-19 is still a bit unclear (only a
                slim
                majority of cases have evidence of previous or current COVID-19 infection), but there does seem to be a
                link
                and it is biologically plausible. This syndrome is serious and definitely needs medical attention.
                Fortunately, it is both rare and easy to spot. The symptoms involve many days of a high fever and,
                basically, your kid seeming really sick. You’d bring them to the doctor for this kind of illness even in
                the
                absence of COVID-19.</li>
              <li>Pediatric Prevalence in NY Not exactly a peer-reviewed study but one pediatric practice in NY sent out
                an
                email saying they’d tested 800 of their patients and found 20% had antibodies to COVID-19. If that
                reflects
                the general pediatric population, it suggests a lot of kids had asymptomatic or mild infection in NY. It
                also puts in further perspective that the serious complications we have seen are very rare.</li>
              <li>Case Series from Chicago Closely related to this general issue of serious infection, one case series
                in
                Chicago summarizes the situation there. Of the approximately 6300 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
                Chicago, 64 were in children 0 to 17. Of those 64, 10 of them were hospitalized. Notably, all of the
                hospitalized cases involved children with some underlying health issues (chronic lung disease, heart
                disease, immune compromised, genetic disorder). This whole paper generally reinforces that children are
                a
                small share of infection and serious illness is rare, especially among those without underlying health
                issues.</li>
              <li>School Transmission The other open question is whether kids transmit the virus. As we open camps and
                schools, will we see this as a major transmission source? We are starting to get some data in from
                places
                that have opened schools.<br><br>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>In Ireland, a paper reports on transmission from 6 infected people in school settings (3 kids, 3
                    adults). Of their approximately 1100 school contacts, there were no cases. That seems reassuring.
                  </p>
                  <p>France’s education minister reported in a video-conference that they have not seen any case
                    increase
                    from school opening (although video conference statements from policy makers are not quite up to the
                    peer review standard).</p>
                  <p>Israel has seen some cases as schools have opened. It is not yet clear how much spread there is;
                    individual cases have been identified and students gone into quarantine, but transmission hasn’t
                    been
                    evaluated yet</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Overall, this is a place we clearly need to know more. I’d personally like to see more data like the
                  Ireland study above, where we are able to track infection spread in schools in a systematic way. I
                  think
                  we’ll see more of that in the coming weeks.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Within the US, I think we will learn much more in the next weeks on this, as day cares and, yes, camps
              begin
              to re-open. I hope we’ll take the opportunity to learn from this as we plan out schools in the fall.</p>
            <p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that food insecurity is worsening and learning outcomes decaying in the
              absence of school. And, related to the topic in the last newsletter, these issues are disproportionately
              affecting Black children and other children of color. The more we can do to figure out how to have kids
              safely
              back in the classroom in the fall, the better.</p>
